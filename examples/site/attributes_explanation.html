  <h1> Attribute Explanation </h1>
  <p> The attributes for Uranium are kind of long. This can be a pain to work with. This is just
    a page to explain why the attributes are as they are.</p>
  
  <p>Let's look at the following example from the <a href="">toggler</a> tutorials:</p>
  <p class="code">data-ur-toggler-component='button'</p>
  <p>Take the first bit: <span class="code">data</span>. We use this in the attribute because HTML5 allows custom attributes, but only
    when they're prefixed with <span class="code">data-</span>. So that's why we have the first bit.</p>
  <p>The next bit of the attribute, <span class="code">ur</span>, is to identify the attribute as a Uranium attribute. Pretty
    self-explanatory.</p>
  <p>After that, we get into the aspects that define which widget you're using (in our example above, the
    toggler) and what part of the widget you want to define. Pretty easy, really!</p>
