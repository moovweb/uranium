    <h2>Lazy and Proper Styling</h2>

    <p>There are two types of styling for Uranium widgets. One we generally refer to as
      "lazy" styling, the other as "proper" styling. Lazy styling requires fewer lines of
      CSS, but proper styling is really the best way to style your widgets.</p>
    <div class="styling">
      <h3>Lazy Styling</h3>
        <div class="styling_para">
          <p>As its name implies, lazy styling is simpler and faster to do. You only really
            need to write out two declaration blocks. The first covers the element in its
            non-enabled state, and the other when the element is enabled.</p>
    
          <p>Say we're styling a toggler button. When <span class="inline_code">"enabled"</span>, we want it to be full opacity. However,
            when disabled we want it to be at 50% opacity. Pretty simple using the following CSS:</p>
      
          <p class="code">
            *[data-ur-toggler-component='button'] {</br>
              &emsp;&emsp;background: red;</br>
              &emsp;&emsp;opacity: 0.5;</br>
            }</br></br>

            *[data-ur-toggler-component='button'][data-ur-state='enabled'] {</br>
              &emsp;&emsp;background: red;</br>
              &emsp;&emsp;opacity: 1.0;</br>
            }
          </p>
    
          <p>Its default state (the first block) describes its color and that it should be at 50% opacity.
            The second block says that when the button is enabled, it will be at 100% opacity. Simple. See
            how it works by clicking on the button below. </p>
    
          <div data-ur-toggler-component='button' data-ur-id='LazyPopup' >
            Popup !
          </div>

          <div data-ur-toggler-component='content' data-ur-id='LazyPopup'>
             <img src='{{site.url}}images/popup.jpeg'>
          </div>
    
          <p>However, lazy styling can cause problems. Let's take a look at a better way to
            style widgets.</p>
        </div> <!-- styling para-->
    </div>
    <div class="styling">
      <h3>Proper Styling</h3>
      <div class="styling_para">
        <p>The problem with lazy styling is this: you're only really saying what the
          element looks like when the <span class="inline_code">data-ur-state</span> is <i>enabled</i>. We're taking it
          for granted that the non-enabled state is the same as the disabled state. This
          is an OK assumption to make in most cases.</p>
    
        <p>But this isn't actually the case. What actually happens is that the element
          goes through a brief period without any <span class="inline_code">data-ur-state</span> before Uranium assigns
          the default (which is usually disabled). (Of course, this doesn't
          apply if you specify in your HTML that the element has a <span class="inline_code">data-ur-set</span>.)</p>
    
        <p>So when we style the non-enabled state in lazy styling, we're actually styling
          <i>two</i> states - the one before any state has been assigned AND the "disabled"
          state.</p>
    
        <p>We can style these states separately, as shown.</p>
    
        <p class="code">
          *[data-ur-toggler-component='button'] {</br>
            &emsp;&emsp;background: blue;</br>
          }</br></br>
      
          *[data-ur-toggler-component='button'][data-ur-state='disabled'] {</br>
            &emsp;&emsp;background: red;</br>
            &emsp;&emsp;opacity: 0.5;</br>
          }</br></br>

          *[data-ur-toggler-component='button'][data-ur-state='enabled'] {</br>
            &emsp;&emsp;background: red;</br>
            &emsp;&emsp;opacity: 1.0;</br>
          }
        </p>
    
        <p>And below is the preceding CSS applied to a toggler.</p>
    
        <div data-ur-set="toggler" data-ur-id='ProperPopup'>
          <div data-ur-toggler-component='button'
           class='popup_button'>
          Popup !
          </div>

          <div data-ur-toggler-component='content'
            data-ur-state='disabled' class='popup_content'>
             <img src='{{site.url}}images/popup.jpeg'>
          </div>
        </div>
    
        <p>The fact is that on a desktop, Uranium works too fast to notice the non-assigned
          state. However, on mobile devices you can sometimes see a delay. You can sometimes
          see the delay if you refresh the <a href="{{site.url}}carousel_examples.html">carousel examples</a> page.</p>
    
        <p>And that's how we style things properly, rather than lazily.</p>
