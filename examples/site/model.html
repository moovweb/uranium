  <h2 name="sets">Sets and Components</h2>
  <div class="model_para">
    <p>Every widget has at its core a set and a series of components. The set is unique for every 
      widget: <span class="inline_code">data-ur-set="toggler"</span> for the <a href="{{site.url}}toggler.html">toggler</a> widget, etc. The set
      attribute should be used to wrap the whole widget.</p>
    <p>There are usually a few components per widget. For example, a toggler has a button and 
      content. Components are designated in the following way: they'll have <span class="inline_code">data-ur-{widget}-component="thing"</span>.</p>
    <p>Most of the widgets also have some extra properties. For example, <a href="{{site.url}}font-resizer.html">
      font resizer</a> has a <span class="inline_code">data-ur-font-resizer-min</span>, which is used to set the minimum font
      size value.</p>

  <h2 name="naming">Naming</h2>
  <div class="model_para">
    <p>The attributes in Uranium are fairly lengthy. This is because we have chosen to follow the 
      conventions of HTML5.</p>
    <p>In HTML4, we weren't allowed to create our own attributes. Only ids, classes and names were really
      accepted. In HTML5, we can &mdash; but we have to start every attribute with "data". So that's
      why all Uranium's attributes start with that. After that, it's "ur" &mdash; to signify that
      the attribute is for Uranium.</p>
    <p>After those two, the names of the attributes are quite straight-forward. data-ur-set helps
      define the following set of tags by grouping them into a set (giving the name of the widget as
      a value).</p>

  <h2 name="declarative_javascript">Declarative Javascript</h2>
  <div class="model_para">
    <p>Uranium works with declarative javascript. What this means is that we give tags in the HTML
    specific attributes. These attributes tell the javascript what to do.</p>
    <p>Here's a couple of simple examples:</p>
    <p class="code">
    &lt;div data-ur-set='toggler'>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&lt;/div>
    </p>
    <p>This attribute tells javascript to treat this div tag as a toggler set.</p>
    <p>And this:</p>
    <p class="code">
    &lt;span data-ur-toggler-component='button' data-ur-state='enabled'>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&lt;/span>
    </p>
    <p>Tells Uranium to treat the span as a toggler button in its enabled state.</p>
