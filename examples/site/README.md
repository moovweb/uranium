# Overview #

Uranium is meant to be :

-  Lightweight
-  Easy to use

That's it!

We've also found it to be quite powerful -- we think you'll find it useful in many settings. But, if given the choice between easy to use and powerful, ease of use is the greater goal. If you find yourself wanting something that a given widget will not do, you're encouraged to extend the widget yourself.

It should be noted that since Uranium extends xui -- this library is geared for widgets that are useful on mobile devices. It also is designed to support mobile browsers (for now just webkit, but you can [build](uranium/blob/master/doc/dev/build.md) it for blackberry/mobile IE as well).

# Lightweight #

## The whole library is 8.4 KB gzipped (including all widgets and xui) ! ##

-  Uranium is based on [xui](http://xuijs.com/) -- the featherweight mobile js library
-  Uranium is bundled with xui to make just one javascript file. [Here](uranium/raw/master/build/src/uranium.js) it is.
-  If you want it even lighter, you can make a custom [build](uranium/blob/master/doc/dev/build.md) yourself

# Easy to Use #

## Uranium requires ZERO programming on your part. ##

Uranium adopts the 'declarative' javascript style. Because of this, you can use the widgets without touching a single line of javascript.

## What is declarative javascript? ##
   
Declarative javascript is a model that looks for how html elements are formatted to construct all the necessary js magic to make those elements come to life. 

## Get Started ##

There are two primary steps to make a widget:

-  Add special attributes to the html element you wish to make a widget
-  Include [uranium.js](uranium/raw/master/build/src/uranium.js)

That's it.

***

-  Take a look at our [model](uranium/blob/master/doc/model/model.md) to see how to implement a widget
-  Take a look at the [widgets](uranium/blob/master/doc/widgets/widgets.md) available.
-  Take a look at our [examples](uranium/blob/master/examples) to see some implementation examples (to use the examples, just download the repo and open one of the test html files)


# Uranium is not ... #

## ... designed for executing logic or site functions ###

Uranium makes the view (your UI/UX) rely on the model (your HTML). The declarative aspect is not designed for performing functions. You wouldn't want to add attributes to an element to perform some js logic (this is exactly why onclicks should be avoided) -- thats what events / listeners / callbacks are for.

## But I need to do x/y/z functions that Uranium doesn't handle ! ##

You're in luck! Uranium bundles with xui -- which (we think) provides a great minimal set of convenient javascript functions (query, add-listeners, ajax, iterate, etc). With this in mind, Uranium is the best of both worlds -- its primary purpose is to make it easy to create great widgets UI/UX -- but if you need to do something fancy, it gives you the tools you need to do so concisely.

# Getting a Widget Approved #

## Technical ##



## Documentation ##

Ideally, you'll write your own documentation. Two pieces are necessary. One is an .md file with a brief description of the widget, plus all the attributes you need for the widget to work. Also, any CSS you need to make it work (e.g. "disabled" should be display:none)
Secondly, we need a list of any cool/interesting ways in which your widget can be used - in HTML format. This will be for our "examples" page.
