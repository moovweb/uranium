  <h1> Geolocator Examples </h1>
  <h2>But Wait! There's more...</h2>
  <p>
    There's some more tricks you can do with the geolocator widget. As you can only have one per page, they're
    located individually. And remember, the geolocator may not work on some browsers.
  </p>
  <p>
    The example we demonstrated on the
    <a href="{{site.url}}geocode.html">widget page</a> loaded automatically as the page did. However, we can include
    a button to initiate this.
  </p>
  <p>
    Also, we don't have to use a select list for the state and country. We'll see in the second example that
    text inputs are fine as well.
  </p>
  <h2>Examples</h2>
  <ul>
    <li> <a href='{{site.url}}geocode_button.html'> Widget fires on button click </a> </li>
    <!--<li> <a href='{{site.url}}geocode_select_elements.html'> Widget populates select elements </a> </li>-->
    <li> <a href='{{site.url}}geocode_text_inputs.html'> Widget populates text inputs </a> </li>
  </ul>
